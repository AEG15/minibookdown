# Introduction
> This book will be a living document where I will add tutorials for any new platform, software, and computational method I learn for my role as Digital Scholarship Librarian. It will include walkthroughs with images, troubleshooting I experience in the process, and links to learn more about doing it yourself.
>
>The ideas I express along the way are my own. I am not paid by any of the digital media developers and I am approaching it from a user perspective.
